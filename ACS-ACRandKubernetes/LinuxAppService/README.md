# Linux App Service
Linux App Service is a progression of the Microsoft Platform as a Service (PaaS) supporting the underlying OS as being Linux.  This has the added benefit of allow Docker images bourne from Linux as the base, and the Open Source Community.

In this workshop we will explore the use of App Service for Linux, as well as Continuous Deployment options utilising GitHub.

## Let's get started
Login the Azure Portal, and search for "App Linux" in the New Resource pane.

Select Web App on Linux and setup your new service.  I'd recommend you create a new Resource Group so you can tear it down easily later.
